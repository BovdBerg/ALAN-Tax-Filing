# Welcome to your Alan project!

The [online documentation](https://alan-platform.com/docs/) contains more information about the online IDE and the Alan platform. It points you in the right direction to get your first Alan application up and running.

We have prepared two tutorials to get you familiar with this online IDE and to start building your first Alan app:

- [Tutorial A: an IDE for Alan](https://alan-platform.com/pages/tutorials/ide-tutorial.html).
In this tutorial youâ€™ll get familiar with the environment for creating Alan applications.

- [Tutorial B: a Restaurant app](https://alan-platform.com/pages/tutorials/application-tutorial.html). This tutorial aims to give you a basis for working with the application language: the main language for building Alan apps.
